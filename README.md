# github-pages
Static website for https://drupal-england-wales.github.io/.

For instructions on testing and updating locally, see https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

If Github opens a Dependabot alert, and it doesn't get closed automatically, the best course of action is to run `bundle update github-pages` locally to make sure any upstream changes have been incorporated.
