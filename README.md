Static website for https://drupal-england-wales.github.io/.

For instructions on testing and updating locally, see https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

If problems occur with Dependabot alerts that can't be resolved automatically, try updating the github-pages gem (`bundle update github-pages`), or the bundler gem (`gem install bundler` and then `bundle update --bundler`).
