	<p><a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/535604">The conversation around
		Drupal England and Wales (DEW for short) started here</a>. While there are
		some great regional groups and events, England and Wales as a whole
		currently have no coordinated Drupal support and marketing effort and so DEW
		was born.</p>

<p>Before we had elected the current <a href="/committee.html">committee</a> there was
	a temporary organising committee. The members of the temporary organising committee (essentially,
	those who have been involved in the planning meetings) were, in no particular
	order:</p>

<p>
	Tim Regester<br>
	Rachel Lawson<br>
	Greg Harvey<br>
	Will Huggins<br>
	George Hazlewood<br>
	Alex Moreno<br>
	Richard Sheppard<br>
	Philip Norton<br>
	Finn Lewis<br>
	Gabriele Maira
</p>

<p>This is the group who have developed and approved
	<a href="/constitution-and-board.html">the constitution and board roles</a>
	.</p>
