	This may be edited more freely and frequently by the new Board,
	once appointed, and they will be able to vote on changes to roles as
	required.</p>

	individuals, specifically in order to avoid Board member burn-out. The roles
	are:</p>

<p>
	Chairperson<br>

	Treasurer<br>
	Marketing Manager<br>
	Event Support Manager<br>
	Community Liaison Manager<br>
	Secretary
