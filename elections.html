	<p>The specific mechanism for recording votes as not yet been decided upon,
	Rachel Lawson is currently investigating options. Due to the current global
	health crisis, things are understandably delayed. Calls for membership and,
	importantly from an election point of view, calls for Board candidates, remain
	open, though there is currently no program for the initial election itself.
	We will update this page when that changees.

	<p>The originally intended election program remains 
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJL9TmT2osaP7yLunP3m3L8R5n5pckmfMgbo8vs_S4U/edit">minuted here</a>.</p>

	<p>When elections do take place, the method for voting and counting will be
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">“instant run-off voting”</a>.
	The outright winner will be appointed Chairperson and the next six successful
	candidates will be appointed Board members, role to be determined at the next
	meeting of the Board.</p>
