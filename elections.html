	<p>We will be using an install of the open source software Helios to vote for the Board, candidates profiles will be posted soon, and the call for Board candidates remains
	open, though there is currently no program for the initial election itself.
	We will update this page when that changes.

	<p>The originally intended election program remains 
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJL9TmT2osaP7yLunP3m3L8R5n5pckmfMgbo8vs_S4U/edit">minuted here</a>.</p>

	<p>When elections take place, the method for voting and counting will be
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">“instant run-off voting”</a>.
	The outright winner will be appointed Chairperson and the next six successful
	candidates will be appointed Board members, role to be determined at the next
	meeting of the Board.</p>
